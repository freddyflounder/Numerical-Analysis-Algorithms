# Numerical-Analyssis-Algorithms
A folder of algorithms written for my first class in numerical analysis, using both python and C++.
The contents include: Runge-Kutta 4, Euler's Method, Adaptive Quadrature, Rhomberg Integration, Discrete Rhomberg Integration, the Composite Trapezoidal Rule, Composite
Simpson's Rule, Composite Midpoint Rule, Neville's Method, and Hermite Interpolation.
All code requires minimal editing to customize it for a specific function and number of given data points.
